"Notes"
"These data reflect laws that were in place as of January 2010, prior to implementation of the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and do not reflect any changes to state laws that may have been made between January 2010 and January 2014 when the ACA's EHB requirement went into effect. Under the ACA, non-grandfathered plans sold in the inidividual and small group markets must provide coverage that is equivalent to an EHB benchmark plan defined by the state. The EHB benchmark plan is required to cover 10 EHBs, including maternity care."
""
"Prior to implementation of the Affordable Care Act when coverage of maternity care became a requirement, the vast majority of group health plans provided coverage for maternity care, including prenatal care. This is due in large part to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), an amendment to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that prohibits discrimination based on gender, pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy-related conditions. The PDA put in place a new requirement that health plans sponsored by employers with 15 or more employees must cover pregnancy, childbirth,and pregnancy-related conditions in the same way as other temporarily disabling conditions. Though the PDA was not a mandated benefit law, per se, it had the effect of promoting maternity coverage under most employer-sponsored health plans. Enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) effectively broadened the reach of the PDA. HIPAA required all health insurance policies for small employer"
"groups (defined as firms with 2 to 50 employees) to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. This means small employers not subject to the PDA nonetheless had the opportunity to buy policies with maternity benefits sold to larger employers."

Footnotes
"1. Applicable to HMO's only."
"2. Applicable to groups sized 15 or greater"
"3. Applicable to groups sized 5 or more. The Idaho Commission on Human Rights Act went beyond federal law to define employer as one who hires 5 or more persons.  As a result, such employers that offer health benefits must comply with the Pregnancy Discrimination Act."
"4. Michigan’s Elliot-Larson Civil Rights Act required employers to provide maternity benefits, if they provide a health benefit plan. This requirement applied to all employers with one or more employee."
"5. Health insurers were required to include maternity benefits in all health insurance policies, per order of Insurance Commissioner. See Order 2-16-94. This standard follows Montana's 1993 Supreme Court decision. See Bankers Life& Casualty Co. v. Peterson, 263 Mont. 156, 866 P.2d 241(1993)."
"6. Only standardized plans were to be sold in the individual and small group market; these plans, except for bare-boned Basic and Essential plans, must have included comprehensive maternity benefits.  Basic and Essential Plans must have covered services related to delivery but not pre-natal care."
"7. Maternity mandate was not applicable to individual market catastrophic plans."
